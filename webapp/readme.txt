Data obtained from user walkerkq on GitHub https://github.com/walkerkq/musiclyrics/blob/master/billboard_lyrics_1964-2015.csv

STATUS: Users can search through for songs of a specific year, of a specified title string, or a string contained within the lyrics.
All references to any song or artist are links which will take the user to a page for that song or artist

NOTES: The way that the data is setup, it was not feasible to account for songs featuring another artist. Instead, each feature is
considered its own artist.
