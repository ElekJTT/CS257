STATUS: Users can select a specific year, search through for songs by a specified title string, by a specified artist,
  or by a string contained within the lyrics. All references to any song or artist are links which will take the user
  to a page for that song or artist. Users can click on the "Billboard Top 100" from any page to return to the Home page.

NOTES: The way that the data is setup, it was not feasible to account for songs featuring another artist. Instead,
  each feature is considered its own artist. Mistakes in spelling or language have not been accounted for.
